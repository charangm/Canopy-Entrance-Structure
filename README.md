## 🧱 Project Description

This is a residential practical application focused on creating a canopy entrance structure for a villa or gated community layout. The design integrates structural elements with aesthetics, including:

- Ornamental **gold-finished support columns**  
- Flat roof shading canopy  
- Symmetry for modern luxury design (shown in render)  
- **ACP sheets (Aluminum Composite Panels)** used as the **finished material** for the top slab portion, providing a sleek, weather-resistant, and modern surface finish

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **AutoCAD** – for technical drafting and detailing  
- **3D Visualization Tool** – used for rendering the final structure (AI-generated image used for visual representation)

## 🧾 Notes

- ACP sheets were chosen for their durability, lightweight nature, and premium visual finish.
- The gold column finish complements the sleek ACP canopy, enhancing the modern architectural aesthetics.
